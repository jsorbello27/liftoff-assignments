# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We are creating this application to make the process of locating trails more simple and efficient for users searching for a specific feature of a trail.

Users can search by name and/or location (city, state, or zipcode), include tags like “allows
pets”, “children friendly”, “rivers”, “paved/ asphalt”, “dirt”, etc.), and users can also narrow search results by selecting the desired duration of trails. In addition, users have the ability to leave reviews and recommendations for trails they have visited. Users will also have the ability to plan a “meetup”  by date, time, and trail location with other users.

We came up with the idea because from having the same shared desire to find local hiking trails that fit our specific needs

### Features
The application we are creating will include features/functionalities such as:

Search: Users will be able to search for specific trials by text, location, tags, or duration.

Write Review: Users will be able to leave a review about a specific trail when logged in and rate it (1-5 stars).

User Login: Users will be able to create an account to access features such as leaving a review or favoriting a trail and viewing all user reviews.

Meetup: Users will be able to plan to meet with other users at certain trail by location, date and time

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf Templates


### What I'll Have to Learn
We will need to learn how to incorporate a map system using google api when users search using location, develop a rating system when users leave reviews for trails.
